My experiments with [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) and [TeX](http://www.tug.org/texshowcase/). Also, planning to
make this my initial LaTeX template repository.

Take a look at [the PDF output](http://github.com/arvindsv/LaTeX.Stuff/raw/master/cheatsheet.pdf) and [the
self-describing LaTeX file from which it was generated](http://github.com/arvindsv/LaTeX.Stuff/blob/master/cheatsheet.tex).
